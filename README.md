## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/MPALONDON/BeautifulSoup-Selenium-Automation.git
```

### 2. Navigate to your project folder

```bash
cd <your-project-folder>
```

### 3. Install dependencies

Itâ€™s recommended to use a virtual environment:

### 4. Set up your Google Form (Optional)

If you want to use your own Google Form:

1. Create a Google Form with **5 text inputs** in this order:
   - Book Title
   - Book URL
   - Book Price
   - Book Rating
   - Book Stock
2. Copy the form URL.
3. Create a `.env` file in the project root with:

```
GOOGLE_FORM_URL="YOUR_GOOGLE_FORM_URL_HERE"
```

If `.env` is not provided, the program will use the default form URL.

---

### 5. Run the program

```bash
python main.py
```

- The program will ask how many pages to scrape.
- It will scrape the data from the specified number of pages and submit it to your Google Form.
- Optional analytics will be displayed automatically before submission.

---

## Analytics

The program creates a simple bar chart showing **average book price by rating** using Matplotlib. This allows you to quickly visualize trends in the scraped data.

---

## Notes

- Currently uses `time.sleep()` to wait for pages to load; WebDriverWait is not implemented.
- Make sure your Google Form is open to accept responses.
- Only works for **Books to Scrape** structure.
